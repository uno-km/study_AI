# study_AI: Large Language Model (LLM) Studies

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding various aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs). It contains Jupyter Notebooks that delve into fundamental concepts such as embedding layers, linear layers, and tokenization techniques essential for LLM development and analysis.

## Repository Contents

### `LLM-Test-Sample` Directory

This directory houses several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific LLM concept:

*   `embedding-Vs-linearLayer.ipynb`: This notebook provides a comparative analysis of embedding layers versus linear layers, demonstrating their roles and applications in neural networks, particularly within the context of LLMs.
*   `PurePython_GPT2_Tokenizer.ipynb`: Explores the inner workings of tokenization by implementing a GPT-2 tokenizer purely in Python. This notebook is designed to offer a deep dive into how text is processed and converted into numerical tokens for LLMs.
*   `GPT2TokenizerComparison.ipynb`: Compares different aspects or implementations of GPT-2 tokenizers, possibly evaluating their performance, efficiency, or specific characteristics.

### Other Files

*   `base_llm`: (Further details can be added here if its purpose becomes clearer, e.g., a custom LLM implementation or a base model.)
*   `cmd_for_colab.ipynb` and `cmd_for_colab (1).ipynb`: These likely contain utility commands or scripts specifically tailored for use within a Colab environment, possibly related to Git operations or environment setup.
*   `the-verdict.txt`: (The purpose of this file is currently unknown; further analysis would be needed to describe it accurately.)

## How to Use

To explore the notebooks and content in this repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal or Google Colab notebook and clone the repository using Git:
    ```bash
    !git clone https://github.com/uno-km/study_AI.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current working directory to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    %cd study_AI
    ```
3.  **Open Jupyter Notebooks**: You can then open the `.ipynb` files, particularly those in the `LLM-Test-Sample` directory, in your preferred Jupyter environment (e.g., Google Colab, JupyterLab, VS Code with Python extensions) to run and interact with the code.
